# srite-bot
GitHub repository for the development of a discord bot called SriteBot.

Usage:
Use this URL to add the bot to a server: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=348653600345423873&scope=bot&permissions=0x00000008
Bot currently does very little. If you are uncomfortable with the admin permission, I can give another link that tones down the permissions.
